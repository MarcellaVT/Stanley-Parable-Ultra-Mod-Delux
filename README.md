# Stanley Parable Ultra Mod Deluxe

This is a mod for The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe game.
It adds keybinds that do different things in the game and even allows you to change the scene you are in.

This was made so i could mess with the game and to see how they made this game in unity. 
Its been fun making this and i hope you have fun messing around with the game.
